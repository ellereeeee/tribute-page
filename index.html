        <p class="indent top-padding">I admire Tom Hardy because he is open about his own flaws and insecurities and also because he's humble about his own successes.  Tom Hardy dealt with drug and alcohol addiction, but recovered and worked hard for his now successful acting career.</p>
        <p class="indent">Tom Hardy is the only child of his family.  His mother was an artist and a painter and his father was a novelist and comedy writer.  He studied at several drama schools in the UK.  He dealt with and overcame an alcohol and cocaine addiction in his twenties.  Tom is currently an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, a UK youth charity that provides mentoring support.  He has two children and two dogs.  Tom has described Gary Oldman as his personal hero.
